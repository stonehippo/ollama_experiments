Experiments with the [Ollama](https://olama.com) local large language model tools.

## Rationale

While I'm generally skeptical of the hype around large language models, GPT, and similar tools, I do think they are interesting and novel uses for this technology. I am interested exploring the possibilities, but I'm opposed to many of the problems that come with using cloud-based LLMs, such as concerns around privacy, security, and energy usage.

I also remain concerned about the underlying issues of LLMS, including the provenance of the training data, concerns about accuracy, misapplication for inapproporiate use cases, bias in the models, and misconceptions about what this technology is, what it does, and what it's really useful for. That said, it's clearly an interesting toolset and may have utility in interesting spaces.
